# Business-Problem #

In March 2020, the first suspect of Covid-19 appeared in Depok, a city in West Java, Indonesia. The number of new suspects was growing ever since then in the nearest areas like DKI Jakarta, Banten, and other provinces across Indonesia. Many stakeholders play their part in this pandemic, including central to local government, medical personnel, and even data scientists. In this case, data scientists help assessed the situations in places on specific areas about availability, quantity, and distribution mapping of health infrastructures like the testing centers and authorized hospitals for patients treatment. In this project, I would like to conduct a simple analysis to determine strategic locations for masks and medical resources for COVID-19 treatment in West Java, based on confirmed cases on 6 December 2020, as well as the red zone areas for “new normal” condition.
